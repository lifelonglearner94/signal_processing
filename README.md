# Corio Signal Processing Assignment

## Overview
This assignment focuses on demonstrating signal processing knowledge, problem-solving skills, and coding abilities using PPG (Photoplethysmogram) and ECG (Electrocardiogram) biosignals. The emphasis is on the approach and documentation rather than obtaining the correct answer.

## Setup
- Create a GitHub repository
- Organize code with good naming conventions and documentation
- Present results in a Jupyter notebook or standalone Python file

## Requirements
- Use only NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries
- Input: 6 .npy files containing 3 PPG/ECG raw signal pairs

## Tasks
1. Determine sampling frequencies of the signals
2. Preprocess signals to remove high-frequency noise, offset, and trend
3. Detect pulse locations in both PPG and ECG signals
4. Identify anomalies or outliers in the PPG signals
5. Synchronize PPG and ECG signals
6. Rank the three PPG signals from best to worst using a custom evaluation function

## Evaluation Criteria
- Signal processing knowledge
- Problem-solving approach
- Coding skills
- Code organization and documentation

## Submission
Submit your solution via the GitHub repository. Include all necessary code, documentation, and explanation of your approach.

Good luck and enjoy the process!
